ChromeNetworkIndicator
======================

A network load indicator for the Chrome webbrowser with statistics

# Install
Just go to your chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions/) and click the button to load an unpacked extension and point to the "chrome" directory.
I will release it on the Chrome Web Store, when it's done.

# Release
It's done, when it's done ;)
